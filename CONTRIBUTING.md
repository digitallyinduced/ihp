## devenv

The IHP framework itself uses devenv.sh to set up the development environment. It is a wrapper around `nix develop` and `direnv`.

Follow the [devenv documentation](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) to set it up.

## Running an application against a local copy of the framework

To work on the framework in your application, you need to clone this repository inside your application directory.
If you don't have a project, first make sure you have the latest version of `ihp-new`, update it by running: `nix-env -f https://downloads.digitallyinduced.com/ihp-new.tar.gz -i ihp-new`. Use `ihp-new` to create one. Make sure to run `devenv up` in your project once. Also make sure that [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) is set up in your shell.

```
# Set up a local IHP project
ihp-new myproject
cd myproject
devenv up
```

Running `devenv up` is necessary, even if you don't intend to run it this way (e.g. you intend to do development and don't intend to run it "normally"), to do some initial setup like creating the database. You can keep `devenv up` running, as it will pick up any changes to the custom app or the IHP, and save you the hassle of manually recompiling from ghci on every change.

Clone the IHP repository into the project directory. The `IHP` directory is added to the GHC search path in `applicationGhciConfig`. Therefore when the `IHP` directory exists, GHC will load all IHP modules from there.

```
git clone git@github.com:digitallyinduced/ihp.git IHP
# Enable direnv
cd IHP
direnv allow
# Go back to the project root (do not run inside the IHP directory)
cd -
```

### Faster Haskell Builds

Uncomment the `configureFlags = [ "--flag FastBuild" ];` and `doHaddock = false;` lines in the `IHP/ihp.nix` for fast rebuilds, otherwise you could up waiting up to half an hour while IHP builds itself.

We need to make sure not to commit the changes of `IHP/ihp.nix`
To help us with that, you can run this from the root of your project `cd IHP && git update-index --assume-unchanged ihp.nix`, so git will ignore your changes.

### Nix Changes

If you're testing local nix changes, you need to change your `flake.nix` to point to the IHP project instead of pulling it from github:

```nix
{
    inputs = {
        # The path needs to be absolute
        ihp.url = "path:///Users/myuser/someproject/IHP";
        # ...
    };
```

After that run `nix flake update`.

### Running the latest IHP `master`

When contributing to IHP core you will want to have your PRs synced with `master`. Your `flake.nix` should have this line:

```nix
{
    ihp.url = "github:digitallyinduced/ihp";
}
```

Then every time you'd like to update to the latest master, you'll run:

```
nix flake update
direnv allow
```

Note that it takes around 30 minutes for the IHP GitHub actions to prepare a binary build of IHP. If you run latest master and the GitHub actions aren't finished yet, you will notice that your computer needs to build IHP from scratch which takes a lot of time. You can wait for the GitHub action to complete or point to a specific IHP commit to avoid long build times.

### Running the development server


When making changes to the development tooling, we have to start the server differently, without `devenv up`. We have to
use `make console` to load your application together with the framework located in `IHP`.

```
ghci
:l IHP/exe/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs
main
```

We don't need to start postgres as the IDE starts it automatically.

#### Debugging the development server

You can enable additional debug logging for the development server by setting the env variable `DEBUG=1`. Like this:

```
export DEBUG=1
ghci
:l IHP/exe/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs
main
```

## Working on the documentation

To work on the documentation locally, switch to the `IHP` directory. When you're doing this the first time, you need to run `direnv allow` to install necessary dependencies:

```
cd IHP
direnv allow
```

Then switch to the `Guide` directory:

```
cd Guide
```

To rebuild the html files from the markdown files on every file change run:

```
make watch
```

This will automatically open a browser window with the compiled html of the documentation. You can now make changes to the markdown files and they are reflected in the browser after a page refresh.

When adding a new markdown page also add it to the `Makefile`. Otherwise it will not be built.

The documentation reads a bit like a tutorial, but should still be kept somewhat complete. Still, refer the reader to the API docs for comprehensive explanations, technical details or less-used functionality. After all, the target audience is coders.

## Code Guidelines

-   Please use `pure`. `return` might confuse people coming from other programming languages.

-   Please add Haddock-comments to new methods intended to be used by directly when developing using IHP.

-   Please consider carefully before adding new packages as requirements to IHP itself. Make sure the packages are actively maintained.

## Running Tests

When inside the IHP directory, you can run the Test Suite by loading it into a `ghci` like this:

```bash
ghci
:l Test/Main.hs
main
```

Note that if it's the first time you switch to the `IHP` directory, you need to run `direnv allow`. This will then download all dependencies needed for IHP development automatically.

When doing changes to the test files, use this to reload and rerun the tests:

```
:r
main
```

After creating a new test you need to still call it from the `Main` module by adding it to `IHP/Test/Main.hs`.

## Branches

Since the switch to nix flakes with IHP v1.1 we're using release branches, to make it easy to upgrade IHP versions using `nix flake update`.

E.g. there's a [branch named `v1.1`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/tree/v1.1) that contains the latest IHP v1.1.x release. When a new IHP v1.1.x release is made, we'll update the `v1.1` branch to point to the new release commit.

IHP apps have a `flake.nix` like this:

```nix
{
    inputs.ihp.url = "github:digitallyinduced/ihp/v1.1";
}
```

This means that whenever someone runs `nix flake update`, they'll get the latest commit from the IHP v1.1 branch.

This will also lead to a change of the `flake.lock` file in the project. This file ensures that IHP is consistently reproduced across machines, so users should also make sure to check this change into git.

To upgrade to a newer minor version, the URL can be changed to use IHP from the e.g. `v1.2` branch:

```nix
{
    inputs.ihp.url = "github:digitallyinduced/ihp/v1.2";
}
```

In the same way as with updating, running `nix flake update` after declaring a new version will update the `flake.lock` file to ensure consistency in all environments.

### New Releases

When we're preparing a new release, e.g. the IHP v1.2.0 release, we'll create a new branch `v1.2` and merge the current master into that branch.

Additionally every released version of IHP is tagged. [You can see a list of all tags on GitHub.](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/tags)


## Troubleshooting

### `error: Could not find module 'Generated.Types'`

You may receive this error when trying to load modules into GHCI like `:l Main`. Run `chmod go-w .` to change the permissions so the `.ghci` file could be loaded properly.

### Type errors in `build/Generated/Types.hs`

The errors comes from changes to the Schema Compiler, so `build/Generated/Types.hs` is outdated. The error only happens when we have backwards compatibility breaks in some of the interfaces, which doesn't happen very often. If you do get them you should execute from your appication's root directory (not the `IHP` directory)

```
ghci
:l IHP/IHP/SchemaCompiler.hs
compile
```

After this the error should be gone, and you can go back to `:l Main`

### Reverting back to running with stock IHP library

If you want to go back and use the standard IHP library instead of the cloned source, for instance when your much needed, contributed and approved feature becomes part of the release, then in your project directory:

```
rm -rf IHP
devenv up
```
