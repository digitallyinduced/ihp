## Static Pages

For adding a static page like e.g. a start page, terms of service, privacy, pricing, etc. you usually use a normal controller which just renders the view for that page. The only special thing is, that you might want to customize the routing to have SEO-friendly URLs.

Let's say we have a controller like this defined in `Web.Types`:

```haskell
data StaticController
    = AboutAction
    | TermsAction
    deriving (Eq, Show, Data)
```

The controller implementation will look like this in `Web.Controller.Static`:

```haskell
module Web.Controller.Static where

import Web.Controller.Prelude
import Web.View.Static.Terms
import Web.View.Static.About

instance Controller StaticController where
    action TermsAction = render TermsView
    action AboutAction = render AboutView
```

We can now customize the routing in `Web.Routes` by first deleting the [`instance AutoRoute StaticController`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-RouterSupport.html#t:AutoRoute) statement to delete the auto generated routing configuration and append:

```haskell
instance HasPath StaticController where
    pathTo TermsAction = "/terms"
    pathTo AboutAction = "/about"

instance CanRoute StaticController where
    parseRoute' =
        (string "/terms" <* endOfInput >> pure TermsAction)
        <|> (string "/about" <* endOfInput >> pure AboutAction)
```

Now the terms can be reached at `/terms` instead of `/Terms`. The about is at `/about` now, instead of `/About`.

Add the static controller to the `Web.FrontController`:

```haskell
instance FrontController WebApplication where
  controllers =
    [ startPage HomeAction,
      parseRoute @StaticController -- <-- Add this line
      -- Generator Marker
    ]
```

## Uploading a user profile picture

You can easily upload a user profile picture using [`uploadImageWithOptions`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-Controller-FileUpload.html#v:uploadImageWithOptions) inside your `UpdateUserAction`:

```haskell
action UpdateUserAction { userId } = do
    user <- fetch userId
    accessDeniedWhen (userId /= currentUserId)

    let profilePictureOptions = ImageUploadOptions
            { convertTo = "jpg"
            , imageMagickOptions = "-resize '1024x1024^' -gravity north -extent 1024x1024 -quality 85% -strip"
            }

    user
        |> fill @["firstname", "lastname", "pictureUrl"]
        |> uploadImageWithOptions profilePictureOptions #pictureUrl
        >>= ifValid \case
            Left user -> render EditView { .. }
            Right user -> do
                user <- user |> updateRecord
                setSuccessMessage "Your changes have been saved."
                redirectTo EditUserAction { .. }
```

This accepts any kind of image file compatible with ImageMagick, resize it, reduce the image quality, strip all meta information, and save it as JPG. The file is stored inside the `static/uploads` folder in the project (the directory will be created if it does not exist).

In your view, just use the image URL like `<img src={currentUser.pictureUrl}/>`.
Note that when you define the `picture_url` field in your `users` table that you
must check the `Nullable` select box with a default `Null`. This ensures your
`pictureUrl` data has a `Maybe Text` type and can handle
cases where the user has not uploaded any image.

If ImageMagick is not installed you will get a `picture.upload` in the uploads folder, but no `picture.jpg`. To install ImageMagick, checkout [Using a native dependency](package-management.html#using-a-native-dependency).

There is currently no special form helper for file uploads. Just specify it manually like this:

```haskell
instance View EditView where
    html EditView { .. } = [hsx|
        <h1>Profil bearbeiten</h1>

        {renderForm user}
    |]
        where
            picturePath :: Text
            picturePath = user.pictureUrl

            renderForm :: User -> Html
            renderForm user = formFor user [hsx|
                <div>
                    <h5>
                        Profilfoto
                    </h5>

                    <div style="max-width: 300px">
                        <div class="form-group">
                            <label for="user_picture_url">
                                <img id="user_picture_url_preview" src={picturePath} style="width: 12rem; min-height: 12rem; min-width: 12rem" class="mt-2 img-thumbnail text-center text-muted" alt="Foto auswahlen"/>
                                <input id="user_picture_url" type="file" name="pictureUrl" class="form-control form-control-file" style="display: none" data-preview="#user_picture_url_preview"/>
                                <a class="d-block text-muted text-center" href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('user_picture_url_preview').click()">Neues Foto auswahlen</a>
                            </label>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                {(textField #firstname) { fieldLabel = "Vorname:" }}
                {(textField #lastname) { fieldLabel = "Nachname:" }}
                {submitButton { label = "Speichern" }}
            |]
```

## Checking that the current user has permission to access the action

Use [accessDeniedWhen](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-LoginSupport-Helper-Controller.html#v:accessDeniedWhen) like this:

```haskell
action EditPostAction { postId } = do
    post <- fetch postId
    -- Access denied if the current user is not the author of the post.
    accessDeniedWhen (post.authorId /= currentUserId)

    renderHtml EditView { .. }
```

Or the opposite command [accessDeniedUnless](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-LoginSupport-Helper-Controller.html#v:accessDeniedUnless) like this:

```haskell
action EditPostAction { postId } = do
    post <- fetch postId
    -- Access denied if the current user is not the author of the post.
    accessDeniedUnless (post.authorId == currentUserId)

    renderHtml EditView { .. }
```

## Creating a custom validator

If needed you can just write your constraint, e.g. like this:

```haskell
nonEmpty :: Text -> ValidatorResult
nonEmpty "" = Failure "This field cannot be empty"
nonEmpty _ = Success

isAge :: Int -> ValidatorResult
isAge = isInRange (0, 100)
```

This is also useful if you need the messages to be in another language.

## Checking that an email is unique

Use [`validateIsUnique`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-ValidationSupport-ValidateIsUnique.html#v:validateIsUnique).

## Don't auto-open the app in the browser

To prevent the IHP development server from automatically opening the development tooling in your web browser when running `devenv up`, set the `IHP_BROWSER` environment variable to `echo`:

```bash
export IHP_BROWSER=echo
devenv up
```

This will then just print out the URL which would be opened on start.

## Getting an `Id Something` from a `UUID`

Sometimes you have a UUID value that represents some record id. To get the types right, you can transform it like this:

```haskell
let myUUID = ...
let projectId = (Id myUUID) :: Id Project
```

In case the id is hard coded, you can just type the UUID value with the right type signature like this:

```haskell
let projectId = "ca63aace-af4b-4e6c-bcfa-76ca061dbdc6" :: Id Project
```

## Getting a `Id Something` from a `Text` / `ByteString` / `String`

Sometimes you have a text, bytestring, or string which represents some record id. You can transform it into an Id like this:

```haskell
let myUUID :: Text = ...
let projectId = textToId myUUID
```

In case the id is hard coded, you can just type the UUID value with the right type signature like this:

```haskell
let projectId = "ca63aace-af4b-4e6c-bcfa-76ca061dbdc6" :: Id Project
```

## Having an image as a Logout button

The `DeleteSessionAction` expects a `HTTP DELETE` request, which is set by JavaScript on click. This does not currently work well with an image inside a link. A workaround is to have the image be the background, like this:

```html
<a
    href="{DeleteSessionAction}"
    class="js-delete js-delete-no-confirm"
    style="background:url(/logout.svg) left center no-repeat;width:40px"
></a>
```

## Making a dynamic Login/Logout button

Depending on the `Maybe User` type in the [ControllerContext](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-Controller-Context.html), by using [`fromFrozenContext`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-Controller-Context.html#v:fromFrozenContext) we can tell if no user is logged in when the `Maybe User` is `Nothing`, and confirm someone is logged in if the `Maybe User` is a `Just user`. Here is an example of a navbar, which has a dynamic Login/Logout button. You can define this in your View/Layout to reuse this in your Views.

> The `@` syntax from [`fromFrozenContext @(Maybe User)`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-Controller-Context.html#v:fromFrozenContext) is just syntax sugar for `let maybeUser :: Maybe User = fromFrozenContext`

```haskell
navbar :: Html
navbar = [hsx|
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">IHP Blog</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>

  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
    <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href={PostsAction}>Posts</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    {loginLogoutButton}
  </div>
</nav>
|]
    where
        loginLogoutButton :: Html
        loginLogoutButton =
            case fromFrozenContext @(Maybe User) of
                Just user -> [hsx|<a class="js-delete js-delete-no-confirm text-secondary" href={DeleteSessionAction}>Logout</a>|]
                Nothing -> [hsx|<a class="text-secondary" href={NewSessionAction}>Login</a>|]
```

You can see this code in action in the [`auth` branch from our example blog](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-blog-example-app/blob/auth/Web/View/Layout.hs).

Protip: If the `Maybe User` is a `Just user` you can use the user object to run specific actions or retrieve information from it. This way you could display the username of the logged-in user above the logout button.

## Making an HTTP request

To make an HTTP request, you need [`Wreq`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq). You need to add it to your Haskell dependencies in the `default.nix` file, like here:

```bash
...
haskellDeps = p: with p; [
    cabal-install
    base
    wai
    text
    hlint
    p.ihp
    wreq <-- Add this
];
...
```

Then you need to import it in your controller/script:

```haskell
import qualified Network.Wreq as Wreq
import Control.Lens ((^.))
```

To simply fetch and render another website, you could use a function like this:

```haskell
handleFetchAction :: _ => Text -> _
handleFetchAction url = do
    documentBody <- do
        response <- Wreq.get (cs url)
        pure (response ^. Wreq.responseBody)
    renderPlain (cs documentBody)
```

When using `handleFetchAction "https://google.com/"`, your app would display the google homepage.

## Confirm before the link is used

To confirm before a link is fired add an `onclick` to the link:

```haskell
[hsx|
    <a href={UsersAction} onclick="if (!confirm('Do you really want to delete the internet?')) event.preventDefault();"></a>
|]
```

## How to generate a random string

To generate a random string which can be used as a secure token or hash use [`generateAuthenticationToken`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq):

```haskell
import IHP.AuthSupport.Authentication -- Not needed if you're inside an IHP controller

do
    token <- generateAuthenticationToken
    -- token = "11D3OAbUfL0P9KNJ09VcUfCO0S9RwI"
```

## Working with Dates in IHP and Haskell

[Working With Dates](https://zacwood.me/posts/2020-12-29-dates-ihp/)

IHP also supports the [postgres interval type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT).
The postgres `interval` fields are bytestrings wrapped in a `PGInterval` data constructor. The wrapped
bytestring is returned to allow users to provide their own custom parsing logic for how they wish
to treat intervals and to support all of postgres' different conventions for reporting interval strings.

A helper module to parse the postgres standard format interval bytestrings into a haskell data structure is also included in `IHP.Postgres.TimeParser`.
The `PGTimeInterval` data type stores fields for `pgYears`, `pgMonths`, `pgDays`, and `pgClock`. This helps users model the particular semantics
of the time intervals and model the way postgres performs `date + interval` arithmetic in their application code.

The default behaviour of the parser *is not* to directly convert the postgres interval of years, months, days, and clock times
into the Haskell `NominalDiffTime`. This is because a day is not necessarily 24 hours nor is a year 365 days.

For example, advancing a timestamp by `1 day` will have a different effect to advancing a timestamp by `24 hours`
on a day with a daylights savings clock shift resulting in a 25 or 23 hour day. In the former case we can ensure the same time of day
is reached on the succeeding day, in the latter case we can land on a time an hour before or after depending on whether the clock has jumped
forwards or backwards.

The `PGTimeInterval` and `unpackInterval` is designed to support these kinds of distinctions.

E.g.:

```haskell
> import Data.Time
> import IHP.Postgres.TimeParser

> let myInterval = unpackInterval (PGInterval "42 days")
> addDays myInterval.pgDays (ModifiedJulianDay 0)

1858-12-29

```

The raw `PGInterval bytestring` that models the database record and the `PGTimeInterval` which maps an interval string to
standard Haskell Date/Time date types (`Integer`/`Int`/`NominalDiffTime`) allow the user to model
the time intervals in their application logic according to the postgres standard.



## Basic Data Scraping, HTTP and JSON

[Data Scraping HTTP and JSON](https://zacwood.me/posts/haskell-scraping-1/)


## How to get all values of an enum?

Given a enum defined in the `Schema.sql` like this:

```sql
CREATE TYPE colors AS ENUM ('yellow', 'red', 'blue');
```

you can call [`allEnumValues`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-HaskellSupport.html#v:allEnumValues) to get a list of all the colors:

```haskell
let allColors = allEnumValues @Color
-- allColors = [ Yellow, Red, Blue ]
```

This also works if you define custom type in `Web/Types.hs` that is deriving `Enum`:

```haskell
data Color = Yellow | Red | Blue deriving (Enum)

let allColors = allEnumValues @Color
-- allColors = [ Yellow, Red, Blue ]
```

## Read a file from filesystem / create a custom 404 page

If for some reason [https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/routing.html#custom-404-page ](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/routing.html#custom-404-page)
is not easy enough - you can also write your own function which reads a file and responses
with a 404:


```haskell
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as LBS
import Network.HTTP.Types.Header (hContentType)
import Network.HTTP.Types (status404)
import Network.Wai (responseLBS)

customNotFoundResponse :: (?context :: ControllerContext) => IO ()
customNotFoundResponse = do
  page <- LBS.readFile "static/404.html"
  respondAndExit $ responseLBS status404 [(hContentType, "text/html")] page
```

Now you can use your `customNotFoundResponse`:

```haskell
action WelcomeAction  = do
post <- fetchOneOrNothing ("30a73014-101e-4269-be91-be6c019de289" :: Id Post)
case post of
   Nothing ->  customNotFoundResponse -- Database record disappeared !!!
   Just post -> render ShowView { .. }
```

## Highlight the targeted element

Let's say you have a page with comments, and you link to them with `<a href="#comment-<comment ID>">`.

The browser will scroll to the relevant comment when you follow the link, but let's say you also want to highlight the linked comment — like GitHub does. You could use the `:target` selector, but it doesn't play well with Turbolinks.

The solution is to assign your own class to the targeted element:

```javascript
// app.js

$(document).on('ready turbolinks:load', function () {
    // Highlight the #hash target
    const prevMarkedElement = document.querySelector('.hash-target');
    if (prevMarkedElement) {
        prevMarkedElement.classList.remove('hash-target');
    }
    if (location.hash) {
        const markedElement = document.querySelector(location.hash);
        if (markedElement) {
            markedElement.classList.add('hash-target');
        }
    }
});
```

And then you can style `.hash-target` instead of `:target`:

```css
/* app.css */

/* Highlight things linked to via #anchor in the URL */
.hash-target {
  box-shadow: #ffe988 0px 0px 0px 3px;
}
```

## Integrate a rich text editor

* Tiptap (a ProseMirror based editor), as used in [windofchange.me](https://windofchange.me): <https://gist.github.com/neongreen/7dbdddae3af0c476340e0dc175552fad>

## Add current year to the footer

It's common for the footer to show some copyright like `© All Rights Reserved 2022`, where the current year is computed, and not hardcoded.

We achieve that by first getting the current time, and passing it to our default layout in our `FrontController.hs`:

```haskell
instance InitControllerContext WebApplication where
    initContext = do
        -- Get the current time.
        currentTime <- getCurrentTime
        -- Pass it to the default layout.
        setLayout (defaultLayout currentTime)
        initAutoRefresh
```

This means that the `defaultLayout` in the file `Layout.hs` will now get the `UTCTime` as its first argument. Rendering the footer with the copyright could look like this:


```haskell
defaultLayout :: UTCTime -> Html -> Html
defaultLayout currentTime inner = [hsx|
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        {metaTags}

        {stylesheets}
        {scripts}

        <title>{pageTitleOrDefault "App"}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {header}
        <main>
            {renderFlashMessages}
            {inner}
        </main>

        {footer currentTime}
    </body>
</html>
|]

footer :: UTCTime -> Html
footer currentTime = [hsx|
    Copyright All Rights Reserved {formatTime defaultTimeLocale "%Y" currentTime}</footer>
|]
```

## Favicon

To have a custom favicon, add a `<link rel="shortcut icon">` to the `metaTags` function `Web/View/Layout.hs`:

```haskell
metaTags :: Html
metaTags = [hsx|
    <!-- ... ->

    <!-- Add this meta tag and adjust the `href` attribute: -->
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/icon.svg"/>
|]
```
