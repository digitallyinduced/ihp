## Introduction

IHP comes with simple email sending functionality out of the box. It's built on top of the [mime-mail](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mime-mail) Haskell package.

## Generating Mails

To send a mail we first need to generate a new email template. For that open the Mail Code Generator from the development tools.

![](images/mail/mail-codegen.png)

Inside the code generator, we have to pick a controller. For our example, we want to generate a confirmation mail to send to new users after they sign up. Therefore we select the `Users` controller from the drop-down. We want our mail to be called `Confirmation` mail, so we enter this into the text field:

![](images/mail/mail-codegen-input.png)

Click `Preview` and after that confirm by clicking `Generate`.

This will generate a new email template at `Web/Mail/Users/Confirmation.hs`:

```haskell
module Web.Mail.Users.Confirmation where
import Web.View.Prelude
import IHP.MailPrelude

data ConfirmationMail = ConfirmationMail { user :: User }

instance BuildMail ConfirmationMail where
    subject = "Subject"
    to ConfirmationMail { .. } = Address { addressName = Just "F L", addressEmail = "fname.lname@example.com" }
    from = "hi@example.com"
    html ConfirmationMail { .. } = [hsx|
        Hello World
    |]
```

### Changing the Subject

Let's first change the subject of our mail from `Subject` to something more useful:

```haskell
    subject = "Confirm your Account"
```

With this change, the new subject is `Confirm your Account`.

### Changing the Email Receiver

We also need to change the email receiver. It's currently hard-coded to `fname.lname@example.com`. As we want our email sent to the email address of our user, we use the `email` field of the user:

```haskell
to ConfirmationMail { .. } = Address { addressName = Just "F L", addressEmail = user.email }
```

Because our user has a `name` field, we can also pass this information to our mail, like this:

```haskell
to ConfirmationMail { .. } = Address { addressName = Just user.name, addressEmail = user.email }
```

### Changing the Email Sender

The email sender is set to `hi@example.com` by default. Usually, you want to use your domain here. For this example, we will stick with the `hi@example.com` for now.

### Changing the Reply-To address

By default the "Reply" button in an email programs creates a reply to the From address. You can change that behavior by setting the `Reply-To` header to another target email address:

```haskell
replyTo ConfirmationMail { .. } = Just Address { addessName = Just "Support", addressEmail = "support@example.com" }
```

### Email Content

Last we need to change the email text a little bit. The mail supports HSX so this is similar to writing an IHP view:

```haskell
    html ConfirmationMail { .. } = [hsx|
        Hey {user.name}, <br/>
        Thanks for signing up! Please confirm your account by following this link: ... <br /><br />
    |]
```

## Sending Mails

From inside a controller or script, an email can be sent by using [`sendMail`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-Mail.html#v:sendMail):

```haskell
action MyAction = do
    user <- fetch "..."
    sendMail ConfirmationMail { user }
```

## Custom Headers

If you need to send specific mail headers you can do so as well:

```haskell
headers ConfirmationMail { .. } =
    [ ("X-Mailer", "mail4j 2.17.0")
    , ("In-Reply-To", "<123456@list.example.com>")
    ]
```

Implementation detail: IHP first adds headers set by itself (like `Subject` and the optional `Reply-To`), then headers provided via `headers`. If you don't want to use the `replyTo` helper from above it's absolutely fine to add the `Reply-To` header manually.



## Mail Servers

By default, IHP uses your local `sendmail` to send out the email. IHP also supports sending mail via AWS Simple Email Service (SES), SendGrid (via Azure or directly) or via any standard SMTP server.

Remember that the successfull delivery of email largely depends on the from-domain allowing your mailserver by means of SPF and/or DKIM. Consult your chosen email server documentation for details.

The delivery method is set in `Config/Config.hs` as shown below.

### Any SMTP Server

```haskell
-- Add this import
import IHP.Mail

config :: ConfigBuilder
config = do
    -- other options here, then add:
    option $ SMTP
        { host = "smtp.myisp.com"
        , port = 2525
        , credentials = Nothing -- or: Just ("myusername","hunter2")
        , encryption = TLS -- <-- other options: `Unencrypted` or `STARTTLS`
        }
```

### Local SMTP with Mailhog

A convinient way to see sent mails is to use a local mail testing such as [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog). This service will catch all outgoing emails, and show their HTML to you - which is handy while developing.

1. Make sure `sendmail` is locally installed and configured.
2. Install MailHog.
3. Enter the following Config.
4. Start MailHog and open the link at http://0.0.0.0:8025/
5. Send an email via your application, and see it in MailHog.


```haskell
-- Add this import
import IHP.Mail

config :: ConfigBuilder
config = do
    -- other options here, then add:
    option $ SMTP
        { host = "127.0.1.1" -- On some computers may need `127.0.0.1` instead.
        , port = 1025
        , credentials = Nothing
        , encryption = Unencrypted
        }
```

### SendGrid

```haskell
-- Add this import
import IHP.Mail

config :: ConfigBuilder
config = do
    -- other options here, then add:
    option $ SendGrid
        { apiKey = "YOUR SENDGRID API KEY"
        , category = Nothing -- or Just "mailcategory"
        }
```


### AWS SES

```haskell
-- Add this import
import IHP.Mail

config :: ConfigBuilder
config = do
    -- other options here, then add:
    option $ SES
        { accessKey = "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
        , secretKey = "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
        , region = "eu-west-1" -- YOUR REGION
        }
```


## Email Attachments

You can add file attachments by adding a [`attachments`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-Mail.html#v:attachments) statement:

```haskell
module Web.Mail.Users.Confirmation where
import Web.View.Prelude
import IHP.MailPrelude

data ConfirmationMail = ConfirmationMail { user :: User }

instance BuildMail ConfirmationMail where
    subject = "Subject"
    to ConfirmationMail { .. } = Address { addressName = Just "F L", addressEmail = "fname.lname@example.com" }
    from = "hi@example.com"
    html ConfirmationMail { .. } = [hsx|
        Hello World
    |]

    attachments ConfirmationMail { .. } = [
        MailAttachment { name = "attachment.xml", contentType = "application/xml", content = "<xml>...</xml>" }
    ]
```


## Plain Text Emails

Every email should have a plain text version for people with reasonable mail clients. If you don't specify one and only set the HTML content via `html` (see above), then IHP automatically creates a plain text version from you by stripping away all HTML tags. This is suboptimal.

The better option is to manually provide a useful plain text version of your emails:

```haskell
text ConfirmationMail { .. } = cs [trimming|
    Hey ${userName},

    Thanks for signing up! Please confirm your account by following this link:
    https://....
|]
    where
        userName = user.name
```

Note a few differences to the `html` version here:

- We use `[trimming| ... |]` instead of `[hsx| ... |]` so we can't use HSX's inline Haskell like `{user.userName}` but have to live with simple substitution. Note the dollar sign in front of these substitutions: `${userName}`.
- The `[trimming||]` quasiquoter takes care of removing the whitespace that our indentations introduced, which we don't want in the actual emails.
- We use `cs` to convert the `[Char]` to the required `Text` type.
