## Restricting an action to logged-in users

To restrict an action to a logged-in user, use [`ensureIsUser`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-LoginSupport-Helper-Controller.html#v:ensureIsUser):

```haskell
action PostsAction = do
    ensureIsUser
    posts <- query @Post |> fetch
    render IndexView { .. }
```

When someone is trying to access the `PostsAction` but is not logged-in, the browser will be redirected to the login page. After the login succeeded, the user will be redirected back to the `PostsAction`.

It's common to restrict all actions inside a controller to logged-in users only. Place the [`ensureIsUser`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-LoginSupport-Helper-Controller.html#v:ensureIsUser) inside the [`beforeAction`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-ControllerSupport.html#v:beforeAction) hook to automatically apply it to all actions:

```haskell
instance Controller PostsController where
    beforeAction = ensureIsUser

    action PostsAction = do
        posts <- query @Post |> fetch
        render IndexView { .. }

    action ShowPostAction { postId } = do
        post <- fetch postId
        render ShowView { .. }
```

In this case `PostsAction` and `ShowPostAction` are only accessible to logged-in users.

## Restricting an action to logged-in admins

To restrict an action to a logged-in admin, use [`ensureIsAdmin`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-ControllerSupport.html#v:beforeAction) instead of [`ensureIsUser`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-LoginSupport-Helper-Controller.html#v:ensureIsUser). If you get

```
error:
    * Could not deduce (HasNewSessionUrl admin0)
        arising from a use of `ensureIsAdmin'
[â€¦]
      These potential instance exist:
        instance HasNewSessionUrl Admin -- Defined in `Admin.Types'
```

then you may have to annotate the type with `@Admin`. For example:

```haskell
instance Controller UserController where
    beforeAction =
        ensureIsAdmin @Admin
```

## Checking for Permissions

You can use [`accessDeniedUnless`](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/api-docs/IHP-AuthSupport-Authorization.html#v:accessDeniedUnless) to allow certain things only for specific users. For example, to restrict a `ShowPostAction` only to the user who a post belongs to, use this:

```haskell
    action ShowPostAction { postId } = do
        post <- fetch postId
        accessDeniedUnless (post.userId == currentUserId)

        render ShowView { .. }
```
