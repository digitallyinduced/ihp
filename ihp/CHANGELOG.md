## Major Changes
- [Added `createRecordDiscardResult`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/c7cbbef728d96f85493494afba8da15d6bf96e70) (complements `updateRecordDiscardResult`) for cases where the result is not needed (e.g. scheduling jobs).
- [Added `copyRecord`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/06e5e30ebe1d9b95d5cbebb3e04513e33ab607e2) for easier duplication of database records.

- Split IHP into multiple packages ([`ihp-ide`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/6b21f550d8a6d843ee85c09150b8e2ba587df248), [`ihp-ssc`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/50fbe028cb2ef5e3646ce5ab59077be68f5a0df1), [`ihp-migrate`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/de021bb3161c8be384a10571963470956aac753c), [`ihp-sitemap`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/996e2431ce7a0e74bbb920cfed6ce7d53f668f58)) for cleaner dependency boundaries.
- Production improvements: [integrated `warp-systemd`](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/d0cf5c6fafa151f3052b39d15f2691f487cefeb4), [added healthcheck endpoint](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/7b685e696c8f7474ac20cd1737525f4bd50566a6), and [improved socket activation](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/250da5a3d569afdd048b135d8e0f7db8de55f719).
- [Upgraded to GHC 9.8](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/a1b0ebb429ae5e95278405be4611b74365e795bb), with support for [9.10.x and 9.12.x](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/commit/5611f77306c076c2a8c2a89b3efcf3afd54fd7fd).
