# Code of Conduct for the IHP Community and Contributors

The IHP community follows the [Guidelines for Respectful Communication](https://haskell.foundation/guidelines-for-respectful-communication/) by the Haskell Foundation. The guidelines have one over-arching rule: We strive to treat every person with respect. [Check out the guidelines on the Haskell Foundation Website.](https://haskell.foundation/guidelines-for-respectful-communication/)

Let's aim for high standards of discourse in our community to be able to build the best software together ðŸš€
