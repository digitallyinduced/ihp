## Getting Started

**CLOSED BETA**: IHP is still in a closed beta. Contact hi@digitallyinduced.com to join the closed beta program :)

[Follow the Guide to build your first project!](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/intro.html) ðŸš€

## Why?

We believe that functional programing is the future of software development and want to make functional programing with haskell and nix available to anyone. We try to offer a solution which can be used by developers who have not worked with haskell yet. IHP comes with everything you need to build great web applications with haskell and nix. We have made a lot of pragmatic decision to get you started faster. This way you can just pick up haskell along the way :-)
